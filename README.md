# Fixed Zoom

Extension that allows you to set a default zoom in Firefox as opposed to 100% that is the default value

## What it does

Before a page loads it sets the saved zoom value, it works by design only on browsing tabs and not on
firefox settings, about:config, etc.

## Does it work?

Sure, but it's my first extension so probably isn't as efficient as it should be.
